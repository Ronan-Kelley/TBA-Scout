add more paths
add an option to grab all the teams at an event, and then calculate their worst round, best round, and average score per round from their most recent previous event
add more cli options so that cool new stuff can be grabbed through command line still
make the UI less ugly (may want to swap to a tabbed layout manager, and develop something labview-esque?)
